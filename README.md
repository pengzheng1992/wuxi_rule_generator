# wuxi_rule_generator
This is a random internet traffic matching rule generator for my wuxi sw dpi project. It's useless for anybody else.
The input file is generated from a ClassBench file which is a random traffic tuple-5 data file.
The output file is a specific traffic rule file for this project.
